In this competition, the main aim is to predict the digit given the image data in pixels.
I used Principal Component analysis Plus support vector machines algorithm to predict.

1. Input the data.
2. The data given is very large and it is difficult to predict on this data as it needs a lot of memory.
3. Principal component analysis is used to reduce the size of the data.
4. Choosing the right dimension for predicting is difficult task and plot the variability explained and dimensions.
5. Dimension = 45
6. Apply svm on the reduced data.
7.  PCA is again used to reduce size of test data.
8. prediction on reduced test data from model.
