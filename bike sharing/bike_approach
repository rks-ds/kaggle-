In this competition the data provided is hourly rental data spanning two years. For this competition, the training set
is comprised of the first 19 days of each month, while the test set is the 20th to the end of the month. We have to 
predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour covered by the test set, using onlyinformation available prior
to the rental period. It is a typical time-series problem

1. Input the training and testing data set
2. Looking at the data first time gives idea that most information containing variable is date.
3. First task is to get date, hour ,month and weekday from the datetime variable.
4. Visualisation of time series data is very important and gives idea of trends.
5.  Variation in number of bike rented with hour on every day of week and with hour in every season using heatmap.
6. Variation in number of bike rented with hour in every season ,with hour in different weather and with hour in every weekend
   using linemap.
7. Most important catch is that the plot of number of bikes rented is skewed.
8. Predicting the model on hour, month, year, weekday, windspeed, atemp, humidity, weather, season, holiday, workingday using randomforest.
   gives 0.47 RMSLE on leaderboard.
